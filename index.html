                <h3>Scotland, the northernmost country in the UK!</h3>
                <p>
                    Scotland boasts a stunning mix of sprawling landscapes and
                    buzzing cities full of culture. You might be aware of
                    tartan, bagpipes and whisky, but Scotland has a lot more to
                    offer. Scotland is recognised across the globe as a land of
                    unrivalled history, breathtaking scenery, and warm welcomes.
                    However, you may not realise that Scotland is also an
                    innovative, diverse, and progressive nation that plays its
                    part in addressing key global challenges.
<p>Scottish culture is rich and unique. Ever ready to offer a friendly welcome to international visitors, Scotland has played host to several major international events and has developed a reputation for providing world-class hospitality. It has recently hosted major sporting events such as football’s Champions League Final, rugby’s World Cup and European Cup, golf’s British Open and athletics' European Championships. In 2021, this trend continued as Scotland welcomed Europe's football elite for a series of games as part of the UEFA European Championships in Glasgow. It is no wonder that Rough Guides recognised Glasgow as the Friendliest City in the World.</p>

                                <p>The famous Glenfinnan viaduct carries the railway to Glenfinnan Station across a 1,000 ft span, 100 ft above the ground. The Jacobite Steam Train* runs from here to Fort William and Mallaig in summer months with regular trains available the rest of the year.

The filming of the second and third Harry Potter books, Harry Potter and the Chambers of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, took place in this area with the Hogwarts Express calling at Glenfinnan.</p>
